# Blog backend

For the frontend, see [Blog's frontend](https://github.com/Danh-Lan/blog-front).

The project uses Spring with Maven, then wrap in Docker to deploy.

# Motivation

The main motivation for this projet is to learn some basics of Spring. 

For a blog post, I think a SSG or static website is good enough, so in the future I may re-purpose this project into something else more fitting.
